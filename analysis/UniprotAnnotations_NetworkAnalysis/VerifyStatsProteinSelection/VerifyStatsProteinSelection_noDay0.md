    ## The following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':
    ## 
    ##     smiths

read in same day log FC and pval data

select only proteins with adj Chi sq. pvalue \<= 0.1

count how many unique proteins are in the list of proteins with adj Chi sq. pvalue \<= 0.1

``` r
nrow(unique(all_sig_pro))
```

    ## [1] 163

make a data frame of just unique proteins so we can select these from the foldchange/pvalue data

read in ASCA data

read in clustering data

make list of ChiSq, ASCA, and Clustering detected proteins

count the number of proteins detected across all methods (overlapping and non-overlapping)

``` r
nrow(all_sig0.1_ASCA_clust_pro)
```

    ## [1] 341

write out the NSAF values for selected proteins

read in list of proteins that mapped to uniprot db

exclude proteins that don't pass eval cut-off

count the number of proteins detected across all methods (overlapping and non-overlapping) that pass the Uniprot BLAST eval cutoff

``` r
nrow(all_sig0.1_ASCA_clust_pro_evalpass)
```

    ## [1] 161

write out the NSAF values for selected proteins that pass the Uniprot BLAST eval cutoff

make a proportional venn diagram to show overlapping proteins detected by statistical methods
