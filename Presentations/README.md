**Bio:**  Shelly Trigg is a postdoctoral research associate at the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington in the lab of Steven Roberts. Dr. Trigg received her Ph.D. in Biology at the University of California San Diego in 2018. Her main research interest is the response of aquatic species to environmental change with a focus on molecular networks and physiology.

**Abstract:**  The Pacific oyster importantly serves as a biofilter and habitat in coastal ecosystems, and contributes over $190M to annual marine aquaculture revenue. However, little is known about the landscape of protein expression during early development, a time when mass mortality is common which can negatively impact industry and ecosystems. To better characterize physiological pathways active during oyster development we performed a developmental time series proteomics analysis of larval cultures reared at 23°C and 29°C. These temperatures were selected based on aquaculture industry reported observations of differential performance in oysters reared at 23°C and 29°C. While we observed no difference in survival, larvae reared at 29°C were larger in size. Protein inventories revealed differentially abundant proteins related to transport and metabolic processes among larvae reared at different temperatures. These results provide deeper insight into mechanisms underlying fundamental developmental processes and how temperature may render larvae more equip to deal with biotic stress.
