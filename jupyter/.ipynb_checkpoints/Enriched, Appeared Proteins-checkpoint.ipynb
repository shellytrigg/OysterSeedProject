    "Here I took the pacific oyster seed data and parsed it by silo, removing all proteins that had abundance greater than 0 on day 1 as competent larvae. Next I organized the data by range and eliminated all proteins that had 0 abundance throughout the experiment. Finally I used [CompGO](http://www.yeastrc.org/compgo_oyster/pages/goAnalysisForm.jsp) to look at biological processes based on gene richment of the protein list I identified. \n",

    "\n",
    "I think it is important to mention that many of the proteins that I identified as being unique did not have GO terms associated with them. Unfortunetly without an associated GO term, this protein is overlooked. This was very disappointing when you consider a protein such as 'CHOYP_ACT.5.27|m.15585' which had 0 abundance on all but 1 day where it had an abundance of 139.5 as seen below.\n",
